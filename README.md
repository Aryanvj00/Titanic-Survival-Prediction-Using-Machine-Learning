### Project Motivation

>This is an attempt to capture my approach/analysis to the Kaggle competition, Titanic Machine Learning From Disaster. I wanted to explore the data to understand the factors impacting the survival and see whether i could predict the survival using machine learning models:

1. Does port of embarkation impact the survival of the passenger?
2. Does gender have any bearing on the survival of the passenger?
3. Does traveling with relatives improve the chance of survival?

>The goal of this repository is to provide motivation for those interested in getting into the field of data analytics or using python for Kaggle's Data Science competitions .
